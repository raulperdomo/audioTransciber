This is a quick little script to help my friend transcribe audio files. 
It takes WAV or FLAC files and uses ffmpeg to split the files into 30 second clips.
Each output files is then run sequentially through SpeechRecognizer and it uses google to transcribe what the clip says. 
The result is then appended to a text file named after the audio file. 

Usage:
 ./speechToText.py <audiofile>
 
 The application will make a 'out' folder which will contain all of the audio segemnts.
